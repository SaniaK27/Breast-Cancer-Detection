# Breast-Cancer-Detection
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset is a well-known public dataset used extensively in machine learning and medical research for binary classification problems. It is designed to help predict whether a breast tumor is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) based on features extracted from clinical images.
This dataset was originally collected by researchers including Dr. William H. Wolberg, W. Nick Street, and Olvi L. Mangasarian using digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) biopsies taken from breast masses. Each sample represents a patient and includes quantitative measurements describing the characteristics of cell nuclei present in the tissue.

The dataset consists of 569 instances (observations) and 30 real-valued numerical features. For each instance, ten primary nuclear measurements were computed and three forms of each were recorded — the mean, standard error, and the worst (largest) values. These measurements encompass a variety of morphological properties such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension.

In addition to the features, there is a target label indicating the diagnosis outcome for each biopsy. The two classes are:

Malignant (M) — indicating a cancerous tumor

Benign (B) — indicating a non-cancerous tumor

The dataset’s class distribution includes 212 malignant and 357 benign cases, making it moderately imbalanced, which reflects realistic clinical proportions.

Because of its moderate size, clinically meaningful features, and clear target labels, this dataset is widely used to train and evaluate machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Neural Networks. It also serves as a benchmark for feature selection, model comparison, and hyperparameter optimization, making it a common starting point for supervised learning projects, medical data analysis, and educational demonstrations.
